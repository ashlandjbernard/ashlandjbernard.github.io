<h2>Five Personal Sites That Caught My Eye </h2>
<ol>
<li> <a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/" target="_blank"> Nomadic Matt </a> 
<ul>
<li>Although far from a simple website, I very much appreciate how user-friendly and accessible it is.  It offers many different subjects from what to pack for where you are going, to how to live frugally while traveling.  It was started by a guy named Matt who developed a love for traveling, and has made it into a full-blown career. I especially like to menu at the top of the page in the bright blue letters that helps you sort through the advertisements so that you can get straight to the pages you want to read.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <a href=”http://www.pausethemoment.com/” target="_blank"> Pause the Moment</a>
<ul>
<li> Ryan Gargiulo’s website Pause the Moment is a blog about his personal travels throughout the world.  He began the website in order to help spread his love of traveling and awesome experiences he has had in order to inspire others to get out there and <i>live in the moment</i> just as he does.  What I especially like about this page is the scene of him looking out at a major basin because it really exemplifies everything about his blog.  It is also very user friendly with the clear and simply menu at the top of the page.  It isn’t a cluttered website and has a sub-section with lots of pictures to go along with his different blog pages. </li>
</ul>
</li> 

<li> <a href="http://davidsbeenhere.com/" target="_blank"> David’s Been Here </a>
<ul>
<li> David Hoffmann’s page, like the other travel blogs, traces the different countries that he has been to and the pros and cons of each country.  I especially like that at the top right corner of the homepage there is a counter with how many countries he has been to and how many he has yet to see.  I think one of the most striking things about his website is the section of the different video shots he has from his travels, which is neatly organized by region and then by country within that region. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <a href=http://twenty-somethingtravel.com/ target="_blank"> Twenty-Something Travel </a>
<ul>
<li>Stephanie Yoder’s page Twenty-Something Travel is travel blog that really speaks to me because of how honest Stephanie is about her experiences and the stage of life she is in.  Although it is a bit more cluttered than I would like for my own page, I really like the drop down menu that offers different advice for different regions, and I like the resources page that offers advice and other websites to check out.  I also really like the color scheme and the graphics on the main page, especially because they are simple and not too extravagant. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <a href="www.ytravelblog.com” target="_blank"> Y Travel Blog </a>
<ul>
<li>Caz and Craig’s travel blog is probably my favorite blog in terms of a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing website goes.  My favorite aspect of this website are the different buttons that take you to different resources for traveling, and the pictures that go along with each of their blog entries.  The blog entries are really interesting in that they certainly don’t glorify or sugarcoat any of the places they have been to, but rather tell it like it is.  I like that nothing on the website is too cluttered or overdone with advertisements. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Persona </h2>
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zkn5vt0tm2b6lay/collegegirl.jpg?dl=0" alt="Kiera Hanson" title="Kiera Hanson" height="300px" width="400px">
<ul>
<li>Kiera Hanson is a 22 year old recent college graduate who wants to spend a year or two traveling before grad school or beginning her career. </li>
<li>She is on a bit of a budget, but really wants to explore and see the world. </li>
<li>Kiera has been to a few different places in the United States, but never overseas or outside of the country.</li>
<li>Before beginning her travels, Kiera looks up what places she wants to go to, what she should bring, what she should see, and how much it will cost her total.  She usually Googles for different travel blogs in order to get an idea from other people who have traveled to these places.  She would rather here about personal experiences, like a blog, rather than a database telling her different statistics.
