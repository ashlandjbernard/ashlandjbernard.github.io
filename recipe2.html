	<h4>Summary</h4>
				</font>
				
This recipe for an elegant North African stew comes out of the kitchen of Boulud Sud, Daniel Boulud’s sophisticated Mediterranean French restaurant in New York. 
<br>It is a dish steeped in the flavors of North Africa, but also of France. Chicken serves as the protein, bathed in a blend of North African spices — cinnamon and coriander, turmeric, ginger powder and cardamom — combined with tomatoes, saffron and a little stock. Preserved lemons and olives added at the end provide bite. Tagines are often cooked with root vegetables and dried fruits. Boulud, who famously grew up on a farm, in Lyon, uses cauliflower. ‘‘It is maybe a little more French approach to the tagine,’’ he said. Blanching the cauliflower and tomatoes before cooking them may cause some cooks to blanch themselves. But the effort is worth it.

<u><font color="838B8B">For the Tagine</font></u>

<ul>
	<li>8 chicken thighs, approximately 3 pounds
<br>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
<br>
<li>2 tablespoons spice mix
<br>
<li>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
<br>
<li>3 Roma tomatoes
<br>
<li>1 head cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets
<br>
<li>1 large white onion, diced
<br>
<li>3 cloves garlic, diced
<br>
<li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
<br>
<li>1 pinch saffron
<br>
<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste
<br>
<li>2 cups chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium
<br>
<li>3 tablespoons preserved lemons, approximately 2 lemons, roughly chopped
<br>
<li>1 cup green olives, like Castelvetranos
<br>
<li>½ bunch cilantro, leaves picked and stems discarded.
</ul>

<font color=”03B4C8”><h3>Directions</h3></font>
<ol>
<li>Combine the spices in a dry sauté pan set over low heat, and toast them gently until they release their fragrance, 2 minutes or so. 
<br>
<li>Transfer to a bowl, and allow to cool.
<br>
<li>Preheat oven to 350. 
<br>
<li>Season the chicken thighs with the salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons of the spice mix, along with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.
<br>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat, and set a large bowl of ice water to the side. 
<br>
<li>Core the tomatoes, and score an X on their bottoms. 
<br>
<li>Boil the cauliflower florets in the water for 3 minutes, then submerge them in the ice water. 
<br>
<li>Boil the tomatoes for 20 seconds, and chill them in the ice water as well.
<br>
<li>Remove the cauliflower when it is cold, and pat the florets dry. 
<br>
<li>Peel the skin off the tomatoes, then cut them into quarters lengthwise.
<br>
<li>Trim away the seeds to make petals.
<br>
<li>Heat the remaining olive oil in a large sauté pan set over medium heat, and sear the chicken in batches, starting skin-side down, until the thighs are browned. 
<br>
<li>Remove the chicken to a large Dutch oven or tagine pot. 
<br>
<li>Remove all but two tablespoons of the fat in pan, then return it to the heat, and brown the cauliflower and add to the chicken.
<br>
<li>Reduce heat below the pan, and add the onion, garlic, ginger and saffron.
<br>
<li>Cook, stirring, until the onions are translucent, approximately 5 minutes.
<br>
<li>Add tomato paste and chicken stock, and simmer until reduced by 1/3.
<br>
<li>Pour sauce over the chicken and cauliflower, cover the pot and transfer to oven for 20 minutes. 
<br>
<li>Remove, stir in the tomatoes, preserved lemon and olives, then cover the pot again and cook for an additional 20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. 
<br>
<li>Serve the chicken in the pot, garnished with the cilantro leaves, with couscous. Reserve remaining spice mix for the next batch or another use. It keeps well in a sealed container.
