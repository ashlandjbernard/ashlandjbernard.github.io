Before I apply to MIT programs, I will be taking an intensive Spanish fluency course in Oaxaca, Mexico, followed by an intensive German immersion course in Berlin, Germany.  I will spend a year in Switzerland interning at a company called Filtrax AG, while teaching English on the weekends.  It is my intention to enter into an MAT program in the fall of 2017 with experience teaching English, fluency in Spanish and in German.</p>
